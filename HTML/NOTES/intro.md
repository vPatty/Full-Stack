Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 

What is the role of HTML in frontend development?
-
    Front-end development refers to the process of creating the parts of a website or application that users see and interact with directly. Front-end developers use a combination of programming languages, tools, and technologies to build user interfaces and user experiences, namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    HTML is used to structure the content and create the basic building blocks of a webpage.

    CSS styles the visual presentation of HTML content, including colours, fonts, layouts, and responsive design for different screen sizes.

    JavaScript is used to add interactivity, dynamic behaviour, and client-side functionality to web pages, such as form validation, animations, and real-time updates.

    Hyper Text is the linking between webpages. These can be internal or external. Internal - Clicking to different links within the same webpage. External - CLicking a link that directs you to a different webpage (external).


Well, what is a markup language?
-
    Markup languages are systems for annotating text in a way that makes it readable by both humans and computers. They use tags to define elements within a document, specifying how the text should be structured, formatted, and displayed. For example, HTML uses tags like <p> for paragraphs and <h1> for headings to structure web content, while XML uses custom tags to define data structures for various applications.

Markup Languages vs Programming Languages
-
    Markup languages and programming languages are both types of computer languages used to structure, display, and manipulate content or data—but they aren’t the same thing.

    Programming languages provide logic that computers can execute. This enables the program to react to inputs, perform calculations, make decisions, and complete tasks.

    For example, you can program a button to change color when a user hovers on it.

    In contrast, markup languages can only define an element's structure and appearance at the time it’s loaded. Markup cannot change an element’s state or behavior dynamically.

    Python, JavaScript, and PHP are examples of programming languages.

Types of Markup Languages
-
    Markup languages can be semantic, presentational, procedural, or a combination of these types.

    Semantic markup (or descriptive markup) provides meaning to content by labeling that content’s structure and purpose. Which can help browsers, search engines, and developers interpret the content correctly.

        For example, in XML, <author>John Doe</author> identifies "John Doe" as the author of an article. But the markup doesn’t affect the presentation of this text.

    Presentational markup controls the visual appearance of content so users see content in a specific way. This markup defines how the text should look without specifying how the system should render it.

        For example, in HTML, <b>Bold Text</b> marks the enclosed text as bold but doesn’t dictate the exact process the browser should use to achieve that appearance.

    Procedural markup provides step-by-step commands for how content should be processed, formatted, or displayed. Instead of defining appearance, this markup directs the system on what to do with the text.

        For example, In LaTeX, \textbf{Bold Text} instructs the typesetting system to apply a bold font weight based on its backend processing rules.

Some of the most widely used markup languages include HTML, XML, markdown, SVG, LaTeX, SGML, and XHTML.
